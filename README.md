# JHipster Microservice Monitoring Demo

Slides available at: [https://pierrebesson.github.io/microservice-monitoring-tools-in-action-slides/](https://pierrebesson.github.io/microservice-monitoring-tools-in-action-slides/)

## Quick start

- Start the stack: `cd docker && docker-compose up -d`
- Scale the microservices: `docker-compose scale store-app=2 invoice-app=2`


## Architecture

![architecture](./jhipster-microservice-monitoring-architecture.png)

## Generate apps and build docker images

RunÂ `./generate-apps.sh`
In every app directory, run `./mvnw package -Pprod,zipkin jib:dockerBuild` to build docker images

## Generate sample traffic

2 ways:

- E2E tests with protractor (drives your chrome browser)
- Load tests with Gatling, measure the performance of the app under high user load.

Start Protractor tests: `cd store && npm run e2e`

Start Gatling tests: `./download-gatling.sh && ./run-gatling.sh`

## Navigating Kibana

- First locate the timepicker at the top right corner, it is the most thing to know how to use
- To save you trouble, we have prepared a **log dashboard** so use it !

- The discover view is very interesting but it will stay cluttered as long as you don't filter things by clicking the small (+) and (-) magnifying glass on values of interest or by using the "add a filter" button
- You also have pre-made dashboards for JVM, service metrics, load metrics, traces

## Custom Dashboard creation

- select the `metrics-*` index pattern
- add filter `metric_type=TIMER`
- search for `* -metric_name=com.codahale.metrics.*`
- Go to Visualize
- Aggregate a metric field with a certain aggregation type (eg. average)
    - metric_p99
    - metric_mean_rate
- Set X-Axis `date histogram bucket`
- Split the series using a `Terms` sub-aggregation

## Distributed tracing with Zipkin and Kibana

- Find a trace ID in your logs.
- Select it with (+), reset your query to * and order logs by oldest first
- You are now following logs accross service calls !
- Automate this by adding a Kibana field formatter in the X-B3-Trace-Id column
- Copy this ID and paste it in Zipkin UI to see the distribution graph
- Get back to Kibana from the Zipkin UI trace view by clicking on the *Logs* button
- Be aware that zipkin sorting works only on the traces already loaded by the query and is not a "full" search
- You can also access Zipkin data in Kibana by searching in the traces-* index

Thank you for joining us in our monitoring adventures !
